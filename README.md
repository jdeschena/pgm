# Partition Generative Modeling - Distillation for text
This branch can be used to distill both MDLM and PGM on OpenWebText. The scripts are located in `scripts`. This codebase is based on [the original SDTT codebase](https://github.com/jdeschena/sdtt). After distillation of the models, you can use the text pretrain branch to sample and evaluate the generative perplexity of the checkpoints.
